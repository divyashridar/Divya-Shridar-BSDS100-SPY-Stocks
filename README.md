# Divya-Shridar-BSDS100-SPY-Stocks
This is the final project where I am doing an in depth statistical analysis on the SPY Stocks data from the past 5 years. 
The file labeled SPY_csv is the dataset I used and is the data from the past five years with 1259 observations of 7 variables (this is the version of the data before I manipulated and altered it). 
The file ending in ".rmd" is the R markdown version of my entire statistical analysis of the spy stocks, coded through R Studio. 
The file ending in "pdf" is the pdf version of the R markdown file. 
*I was not able to fit the comments in one smooth flow without it cutting off on the pdf versions, hence the the comments (which are longer than a sentence) are split into separate lines on the R markdown and PDF file.*
